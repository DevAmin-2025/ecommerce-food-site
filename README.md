# eCommerce Food Website â€“ Laravel 12
This repository contains the customer-facing website for an eCommerce food ordering platform built with Laravel 12. It provides all the functionality for customers to browse products, manage their cart, place orders, and interact with support and account features. It works alongside a separate admin panel that handles backend management.

**Note:** The frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Alpine.js, etc.) were pre-built and **not developed by me.** This project focuses exclusively on Laravel backend development and integration with the frontend.

## Features
- Customer registration, login, and password reset.
